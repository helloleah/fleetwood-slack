Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know


Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had, oh, what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know

You will know, you'll knowI took my love, took it down
I climbed a mountain, and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmmmm

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too


Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Oh, I'm getting older too

I take my love, take it down
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down

And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down
Oh, the landslide will bring it downListen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)


(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadowYou could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing

Did you say that she's pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby, I don't want to know

So I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me, no

Did you say that she's pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby, I don't want to know

Oh no, and can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't want to know

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me


Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well, I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
(Give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Was I just a fool?
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
(Give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
(Was I just a fool)

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let meRhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

Rhiannon

And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mindLoving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, maybe I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?

You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)

Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up, shacking up's all you wanna do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you

You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)


You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day


You can go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own waySo I'm back, to the velvet underground
Back to the floor, that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was
To the gypsy that I was

And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does
And lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
Oh, and it lights up the night
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy

To the gypsy that remains
Faces freedom with a little fear
I have no fear, I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love

She is dancing away from me now
She was just a wish
She was just a wish
And a memory is all that is left for you now
You see your gypsy, oh
You see your gypsy

Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you

I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
(She was just a wish)
(She was just a wish)
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to youFor you, there'll be no more crying
For you, the sun will be shining
And I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

To you, I'll give the world
To you, I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

And I wish you all the love in the world
But most of all, I wish it from myself

And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

Like never before
Like never before​

If I could turn the page
In time, then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

Calling out your name

Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud
And I can't get the words out

Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere

Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly
Come along, baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere

Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I’ll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out

Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale

Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Well, is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

Well did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
And now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how to pick up the pieces
And go home? And go home, and go home

Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Ooh, black widow
Ooh, pale shadow, she’s a dragon
Gold dust woman
Woman, womanShe broke down and let me in
Made me see where I'd been

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again


You don't know what it means to win
Come round and see me again

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back againIf you wake up and don't wanna smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Why not think about times to come?
And not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone


All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look backWait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me 'bout the fire

Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home

And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
And undoing, and undoing
Ooh the laces
Undoing the laces

Said Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, never stop
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house
Oh then call me home

Hold on
The night is coming and the starling flew for days
I'd stay home at night all the time
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'm there, yeah
Ask me and I'm there 'cause I care

In the sea of love
Where every woman would love to drown
But now it's gone
They say it doesn't matter anymore
If you build your house
Then please, call me home

Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, and don't you ever stop
And now it's gone
No, it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by

Sara
All I ever wanted, was to know that you were dreaming, Sara
There’s a heartbeat that never really died
Oh, won't you swallow your pride?Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?
Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him who's the latest on his throne?

Don't say that you love me, hiyee-ha
Just tell me that you want me, hiyee-ha
Tusk!
Just say that you want me, hiyee-ha
Don't say that you

Tusk!
Real savage-like
Tusk!
Tusk!
Tusk! Tusk! Tusk!So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline

But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry, but

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)
(Aaron)

So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me

But if our paths never cross
Well, no, I'm not sorry, but

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)
(Aaron)

So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand

If I hope and if I pray
Ooh, it might work out someday

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (I'll make a path there)
I'll never live to match the beauty again (I'll never live to see that beauty, that beauty, that same same beauty again)
If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
(Well if I hope and I pray)
(Well maybe it might work out someday)
If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)I know there's nothing to say
Someone has taken my place
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

I know I got nothing on you
I know there's nothing to do
When times go bad
And you can't get enough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

Someone who's going to give you peace of mind

You make me happy with the things you do
Oh, can it be so?
This feeling follows me wherever I go

I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why


I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why

Don't, don't break the spell
It would be different and you know it will
You, you make loving fun
And I don't have to tell you but you're the only one

You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

Finally, baby
The truth has come down now
Take a listen to your spirit
It's crying out loud
Trying to believe
Oh, you say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Oh, oh, yeah, uh huh

I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

Finally, baby
The truth has been told
Now you tell me that I'm crazy
It's nothing that I didn't know
Trying to survive
Oh, you say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Hanging on to you
Oh, oh, yeah, uh huh

I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love, honey
Take a little time


Ah, I don't want to knowHave mercy, baby, on a poor girl like me
You know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Have pity baby just when I thought it was over
Now you got me running, running, running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
{Instrumental Bridge}

Baby, baby, hope you're going to stay away
Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me

Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling...Oh, Daddy
You know you make me cry
How can you love me?
I don't understand why

Oh, Daddy
If I can make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

Oh, Daddy
You soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know
You're the best thing in my life

Oh, Daddy
If I can make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

Why are you right when I'm so wrong?
(So wrong)
I'm so weak but you're so strong (Ooh)
(Never so strong)
Everything you do is just all right
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried


Why are you right when I'm so wrong?
(So wrong)
I'm so weak but you're so strong (Ooh)
(Never so strong)
Everything you do is just alright
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried

Oh, Daddy
You soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know
You're the best thing in my life

Oh, Daddy
If I can make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

Yes, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be meEvery night that goes between
I feel a little less
As you slowly go away from me
This is only another test
Every night you do not come
Your softness fades away
Did I ever really care that much?
Is there anything left to say?

Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside

I haven't felt this way I feel
Since many a years ago
But in those years are the lifetime's past
I did not deal with the road
And I did not deal with you, I know
Though the love has always been
So I search to find an answer there
So I can truly win

Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside

So I try to say goodbye, my friend
I'd like to leave you with something warm
But never have I been a blue calm sea
I have always been a storm
Always been a storm
Ooh, always been a storm
I have always been a storm

We were frail
She said, "Every night he will break your heart"
I should have known from the first
I'd be the brokenhearted
I loved you from the start
Save us
And not all the prayers in the world will save usI can't help about the shape I'm in
Can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
Oh, well

Now, when I talked to god, I knew he'd understand
He said, "Stick by my side and I'll be your guiding hand
Don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to"
Well

Oh, well, oh, well
Well, well, well, wellLooking out for love
In the night so still
Oh, I'll build you a kingdom
In that house on the hill

Looking out for love
Big, big love

You said that you love me
And that you always will
Oh, you beg me to keep you
In that house on the hill

Looking out for love
Big, big love

Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

I wake up
Alone with it all
I wake up
But only to fall

Looking out for love
Big, big love
Just looking out for love
Big, big love

Baby, don't you hand me a line
Although it doesn't matter
You and me got plenty of time
There's nobody in the future
So baby let me hand you, my love
There's no step for you to dance to
So slip your hand inside of my glove

Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me

I don't want no damage
But how'm I going to manage with you
You hold the percentage
But I'm the fool payin' the dues
I'm just around the corner
If you got a minute to spare
I'll be waitin' for you
If you ever want to be there

Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold meMonday morning, you sure look so fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, then you fade away
I can't go on believing this way
I got nothing but love for you
So tell me what you really want to do
First you love me, then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
I don't mind

I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

Monday morning, you sure look so fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me then you say it's wrong
I can't go on believing for long
But you know it's true (Yes)
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me, then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
I don't mind

I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

But you know it's true
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me, then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
I don't mind

I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mindIntense silence
As she walked in the room
Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon
And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me
Heavy persuasion
It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
And she called to me
And so I followed
As friends often do
I cared not for love, nor money
And I think she knew
Well the people, they love her
And still they are the most cruel
She asked me, be my sister
Sister, sister of the moon
Some call her sister of the moon
Some say illusions are her game
They like to wrap her in velvet
Does anyone, ooh, know her nameDo you always trust your first initial feeling
Special knowledge holds true, bears believing
I turned around and the water was closing all around
Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me

Then I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like a clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet, to the sea
To the sea
To the sea, yeah

How the faces of love change, turning the pages
And I have changed, oh but you, you remain ageless
I turned around and the water was closing all around
Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me

Then I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like a clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet, to the sea
To the sea
To the sea, yeah
To the sea, yeahBeautiful child
Beautiful child
You are a beautiful child
And I am a fool once more
You fell in love when I was only ten
The years disappeared
Much has gone by since then
I bite my lip, can you send me away
You touch
I have no choice
I have to stay
Ooh, I had to stay
Ooh, I had to stay
Sleepless child
There is so little time
Your eyes say yes
But you don't say yes
Well, I wish that you were mine
I wish that you were mine
You say it will be harder in the morning
I wait for you to say, just go
Your hands, held mine so few hours
(I fell into love)
But I'm not a child anymore
I'm not a child anymore
I'm tall enough
To reach for the stars
I'm old enough
To love you from afar
Too trusting, yes
But then women usually are
(I'm not a child anymore)
I'm not a child, oh no
(I'm tall enough to reach for the stars)
I will do as I'm told
(I'm old enough to love you from afar)
Even if I never hold you again
(Too trusting yes, but then women usually are)
Hold you again
(Hold you again)
Sleepless child
There is so little time
(I will do as I am told)
Your eyes say yes
But you don't say yes
(Even if I never hold you again)
I wish that you were mine
(Hold you again)
I wish that you were mine
(Even if I never hold you again)
Well I wish that you were mine
(Hold you again)
Well I wish that you were mine
(Hold you again)
(I'm not a child anymore)Got a black magic woman
I got a black magic woman
Yes, I got a black magic woman
She's got me so blind I can't see
But she's a black magic woman
And she's trying to make a Devil out of me

Don't turn your back on me baby
Don't turn your back on me baby
Don't turn your back on me baby
Yes, don't turn your back on me baby
You're messing around with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me baby
Because you might just break up my magic stick

You got your spell on me baby
You got your spell on me baby
Yes, you got your spell on me baby
You're turning my heart into stone
I need you so bad, magic woman
I can't leave you alone

Yes, I need you so bad
Well, I need you darling
Yeah, I need you darling
Yes, I want you to love me
I want you to love me
Whoa, I want you to love me, ah
Whoh, yeah
Oh, whoa, baby
Yes, I need your love
Oh, I need your love so bad
Yes, I want you to love meI've been alone
All the years
So many ways to count the tears

I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die

I been alone
Always down
No one cared to stay around

I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die
How I feel
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die{Intro}

You can take me to the paradise
And then again you can be cold as ice
I'm over my head (over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice

You can take me anytime you like
I'll be around if you think you might
Love me, baby (over my head)
And hold me tight

Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time
{Instrumental}

Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time

I think, I'm looking on the dark side
But everyday you hurt my pride
I'm over my head (over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice
I'm over my head (over my head)
But it sure feels nice
I'm over my head (over my head)
But it sure feels nice
{Outro}Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad
I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad
So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad
Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so badAnd the planets of the universe go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon, or by the day
You and I will simply disappear out of sight
But I'm afraid soon there'll be no light
I will never love again the way I loved you
You will never rule again the way you've ruled
We will never change again the way we are changing
Oh, you'll forget the chill of love but not the strain
Oh, you'll forget the chill of love but not the strain
You will remember but I will die slowly
It's only an overture to something that was best
And don't, don't condescend me
Take your leave
Take your leave
Take your leave of me now
Disappear through the year
I wish you gone and I don't care
Now I know
Well, I was wrong
To live for a dream
If I had my life to live over
I would never dream
Oh, I would never dreamAll it took was a special look
And I felt I knew you before
I didn't mean to love you
Didn't think it would work out
But I knew we would be together
And I couldn't wait for more
But what can they say
It's not against the law

I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me

I believe that you really want me
But it's not easy, just to give in
So let yourself go, and let love begin

I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me
I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me

Baby, once in a while
Think about me
Baby, once in a while
Think about me
Think about me
Every, every once in a while
Think about meSometimes, the most beautiful things
The most innocent things
And many of those dreams, pass us by
Keep passing me by

You feel good
I said it's funny that you understood
I knew you would
When you were good, you were very, very good

So I close my eyes softly
'Til I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime, yeah
And to those that I love, like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel of my dreams
Angel of my dreams

(You said) You feel good
I said it's funny that you understood
I knew you would
When you were good, baby
You were very good

I still look up, when you walk in the room
I've the same wide eyes, now they tell the story
I try not to reach out, when you turn 'round you say hello
And we both pretend
I'm no great pretender

So I close my eyes softly
'Till I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime
And to those that I love, like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel, angel of my dreams
Angel of my dreams

I still look up
I try hard not to look up, yeah
That girl was me, yeah
Track a ghost through the fog, yeah
A charmed hour and a haunted song

Track a ghost through the fog, baby
Track a ghost through the fog, baby
Ooh, you try hard
But you'll never catch me, yeah
That girl was me
Ooh, you try hard
But you'll never catch me, yeahShall I tell you about my life
They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls
I guess I've got everything I need
I wouldn't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
But I just wish that I'd never been born
And I need a good woman
To make me feel like a good man should
I don't say I'm a good man
Oh, but I would be if I could
I could tell you about my life
And keep you amused I'm sure
About all the times I've cried
And how I don't want to be sad anymore
And how I wish I was in loveIt was a blue letter she wrote to me
It's silver words she told
Wanna be on the road to paradise
I want a lover who don't get old

Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waiting around for you

For every voice you've ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Give me one more song to go

Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waiting around for you


For every voice you've ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Give me one more song to go

Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waiting around for you

I ain't waiting Could you ever need me
And would you know how, yeah
Don't waste our time
Tell me now
All you have to do
Is speak out my name, yeah
And I would come running
Anyway

And I said
Could it be me?
Could it really, really be?
Over and over
Could it really, really be?
Over and over

Don't turn me away
And don't let me down
What can I do
To keep you around

Over and over She's so crazy
She's so lazy
Keeps on coming
Keeps you running

She's so stagey
So attractive
So reactive

CarolineListen to the wind on the water
Listen to the waves upon the shore
Try to sleep, sleep won't come
Just as I begin to fade

Then I remember
When the moon was full and bright
I would take you in the darkness
And do the tango in the night
Tango

I keep the dream in my pocket
Never let it fade away
Inside, outside
No loneliness in this dream

Then I remember
When the moon was full and bright
I would take you in the darkness
And do the tango in the night
TangoSomething in you brought out something in me
That I've never been since
That part of me that was only for you
That kind of romance
Comes only once, that kind of love
That kind of fever dance
That you love because you become someone else in an instant

Say you will, say you will give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance

Something in you put a hold on my heart
It's hard to believe now
Here in the place that will never be dark
I remember that place
That kind of touch, electricity of love
That certain kind of grace
That you love because you become someone else in an instantCounting on my fingers
Counting on my toes
Slipping thru your fingers
Watching how it grows
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you what it's really all about

Do you ever wonder
Do you ever hate
Six feet under
Someone who can wait
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you
Oughta tell you what it's really all about
You're never gonna to make it baby
Oh I guess I'm gonna make you crazy
Make it babe
Make it babe
Make it babe

Counting on my fingers
Counting on my toes
Slipping thru your fingers
Watching how it grows
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you what it's really all about

Buy another fixture
Tell another lie
Paint another picture
See who's surprised
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta
Someone oughta tell you what it's really all about
You're never going to make it baby
Oh you're never gonna make it crazy
Oh you're never gonna

Someone oughta someone oughta
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you
Oughta tell you what it's really all aboutIt's the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining what your imagination
Can make you see and feel

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North
Carolina and a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
I know that's right


Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question
To ask if those stories are right
Because what matters most if the feeling
You get when you're hypnotized

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Yeaaaaahhhh
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotizedHe fell for her again, she watched it happen
Every day, day by day
But more important, night by night
She watched it all come into play
He held her hands, she listened to what he had to say

Thrown down, like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together

You've shaken your faith in me, no
You've shaken my faith in everything else
A decision no one makes, and now you're going home
Faith is a hard thing to hold on to
Something inside you says I don't have to
You're not like other people, you do what you want to
You're not like other people, you do what you want to

Thrown down, like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together

You say you're sorry
Now you should walk away
But it's so overwhelming
You have nothing left to say
You can sit outside his door and wait
Well, you can dedicate your pain to him

All thrown down, like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together

About just how much he never really told her
Thrown down
About how difficult it had been to be without her
Thrown downYou look at me with those brown eyes
What do you want to do?
Do you have to have me
The way that I want you? I want you

Sha-la-lah

When you look at me with those brown eyes
What do you want to say?
And are you just another liar?
Will you take me all the way? All the way?

Sha-la-lahSleep easy by my side
Into gentle slumber you can hide
I, I'm waiting for the sun, to come up
I can't sleep, with your warm ways

Forever, forever love
Together, together love

You made me a woman tonight
Dream until the morning light
I, I'm waiting for the sun, to come up
I can't sleep, with your warm ways

Forever, forever love
Together, together loveI've been searching
For a pot of gold
Like the kind you find
At the end of the rainbow
I've been dreaming
I thought it was in vain
Ah but now you're here
Can't believe that you're back again

Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm going to win
(I'm going to win)
I'm going to beg, steal, or borrow
As long as you follow

I've been wandering
Gone away too far
But the road was rough
To get back where you are
And the sun went down
It never seemed to rise
Ah but now you're here
With the light shining in your eyes


(As long as you follow)
As long as you follow
(As long as you follow)
As long as you followWhat makes you think you're the one
Who can laugh without crying?
What makes you think you're the one
Who can live without dying?
Every little bit
Is there
To see
Every little bit
Of you
And me
What makes you think I'm the one
Who'll be there when you're callin'?
What makes you think I'm the one
Who will catch you when you're fallin'?
Every little bit
Is there
To see
Every little bit
Of you
And me
What makes you think I'm the one
Who will love you forever?
Everything you do has been done
And this won't last forever
Every little bit
Is there
To see
Every little bit
Of you
And meWell I need a sugar daddy
He could be my friend
And if I needed a little money
I know he would lend me, lend me a hand

But when it comes to loving
He'd better leave me alone
Because I've got you baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes you give me all the love I need

And when I get a little hungry
If he could give me all I could eat
And if I needed whiskey
He could serve it to me neat

But when it comes to love
He'd better leave me alone
Because I've got you baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes you give me all the love I need

All that I want is someone to take care of me
I'm not asking for love, just a little sympathy

And he could pick me up
In a big fancy car
Then I could pretend
I was a big movie star

But when it comes to love
He'd better leave me alone
Because I've got you baby
And you give me all the love I need
Yes you give me all the love I need

All that I want is someone to take care of me
I'm not asking for love, just a little sympathy

I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love
Just a little sympathy
I'm not asking for love
I'm not asking for love ...
